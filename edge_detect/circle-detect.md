# The result of circle_detect.py

The good thing is that this script succeeded to detect the target circle, the only complete circle shape in the image.
The list returned by `HoughCircles()` started with the target circle.
Other detected circles are noise caused by characters or partial circular figures in the image.

## Speed

About 20 seconds to find the target circle.
